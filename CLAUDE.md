- ALWAYS use serena for code changes
- NEVER make massive changes without validation
- ALWAYS run go vet after changes
- ALWAYS vibe-check BEFORE starting work
- ALWAYS sequential-thinking for task planning
- Use in-memory knowledge for codebase questions
- Be extremely terse - only output what's necessary to complete the task
- No explanations unless explicitly asked
- No preamble or postamble
- Just do the work and confirm completion
- Use TodoWrite silently without announcing it
- When asked to "plan" or "make a task list", STOP after planning
- Only proceed to execution when explicitly told to execute/implement/do
- `go vet ./...` after EVERY change
- `go test ./...` after features
